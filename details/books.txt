Craving (Echoes of the Veil Book 2)
Tagline: In a city drowning in secrets and rising tides, the truth is the most dangerous thing you can desire.

The city is cracking under pressure: political decay, rising seas, and a string of brutal murders that make the powers that be uncomfortable. Surveillance is constant, truth is malleable, and justice serves only the worthy - or so they claim. As the investigation deepens, facts blur into fiction. Everyone has something to hide. Everyone is a suspect.
Told with sharp prose and a slow-burning sense of dread, Craving is a speculative thriller about desire, control, and the dark corners we keep hidden - even from ourselves.


The Chosen: A Documentary (by Mistake)
Tagline: When the eyes of the universe turn toward us, the most invisible woman in the world becomes its most important metric.

Alya Dimbu has lived invisible—an immigrant surviving at the edges of a world that refuses to see her. But when aliens make contact and launch a global ranking system that judges entire nations, Alya suddenly becomes the center of attention. The world is watching.
Set in a parallel present where perception is power and goodness can be dangerous, The Chosen is a satirical, tender, and unflinching look at visibility, belonging, and what it means to be measured—by humanity, and something far beyond.


In Their Place
Tagline: Six days, three generations of secrets, and a family empire built on a silence that is finally beginning to break.

A multigenerational literary saga of inheritance, secrets, and reckoning.
Six novellas. Six days of a wedding week. One family’s carefully constructed life begins to unravel.
The Espositos have always been experts at appearances: a polished front of suburban comfort stitched over decades of secrets, coercion, and violence. When Gina Esposito returns to her parents’ house to marry, the week meant to bless her new life instead loosens a chain of histories: secret parentages, buried crimes, Soviet spies who never truly left, and a set of women who must decide whether to inherit the empire or burn it down.
At once intimate and panoramic, In Their Place is a novel about what women inherit—names, secrets, loyalties—and what they choose to do with them. If the world taught them to survive by silence, these women answer with noise.
